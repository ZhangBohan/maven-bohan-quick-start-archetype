Summary
-------
Maven archetype providing a pre-configured Spring MVC setup out of the box. The setup represents how I like things configured for a quick setup so YMMV.

This is my first archetype, feel free to send patches if you find something that can be improved.

Features
--------
Some features that work out of the box are:

* Bare bones Spring MVC controller and a simple test.
* Tomcat ready (maven plugin).
* Annotation driven Spring MVC controllers.
* Configured ContentNegotiatingViewResolver, with JSON as a registered media type.
* JSTL view resolver.
* Cookie based locale resolver / interceptor.
* Transaction support.
* UTF-8 character encoding filter for web pages.
* Spring taglib support.
* i18n support via Spring MessageSource.
* Basic DataSource configuration, JdbcTemplate and TransactionManager configuration. Its up to you to configure the dataSource
  in datasource-beans.xml for persistence to actually do something.
* PropertyPlaceholder support.


Local Install
-------------
clone repository
cd maven-bohan-qucik-start-archetype (or your custom clone location)
mvn install


Use
---
cd ~/work (or wherever you want to build to)

mvn archetype:generate \
  -DarchetypeGroupId=me.nengzhe \
  -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-bohan-qucik-start-archetype \
  -DarchetypeVersion=1.0-SNAPSHOT \
  -DgroupId=your_group_id \
  -DartifactId=the_artifact_id \
  -Dpackage=the_package_name
  -DinteractiveMode=false \
  -DarchetypeCatalog=local

Answer the questions and the build will end up in a directory named after your artifact ID. Configure the dataSource bean in datasource-beans.xml to match your database configuration.

cd $artifactId ; mvn jetty:run

Go to http://localhost:8000/ and the example page should load.
